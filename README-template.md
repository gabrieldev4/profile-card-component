## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

UI learned how to place two background images dividing half the height and half the width of the page. And I also reviewed the properties that center an item in the middle of the screen using justify-content and align-content, of course, depending on other configurations for it to occur correctly.

### Continued development

I intend to continue improving front-end development with HTML and CSS, but I also want to implement the knowledge I am acquiring from Bootstrap and JavaScript.
